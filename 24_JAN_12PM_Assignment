1.	Write a program that creates a class called "Student" with the following data members:
name (string)
age (int)
grade (double)
In the main function, create an instance of the Student class and initialize its data members. Then, open a file for writing and write the contents of the Student object to the file.

Ans:

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int age;
    double grade;
};

int main() {
    Student student;
    student.name = "John Doe";
    student.age = 20;
    student.grade = 3.5;

    ofstream outFile;
    outFile.open("students.txt");

    outFile << student.name << " " << student.age << " " << student.grade << endl;

    outFile.close();

    cout << "Student information saved to file." << endl;

    return 0;
}

2.	Write a program that reads the contents of a file containing Student objects and prints them to the console.
The program should open the file, read the Student objects one at a time, and print their name, age, and grade to the console.

Ans:
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	fstream file;
	string s;
	file.open("abc",ios::in);
	while(file>>s)
	{
		cout<<s<<" ";
	}
	file.close();
}

3     Create a class called "Book" with the following data members:
title (string)
author (string)
ISBN (string)
price (double)
stock (int)
In the main function, create an instance of the Book class and initialize its data members. Then, use the fstream
library to open a file for writing and write the contents of the Book object to the file in binary format.

Ans:
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

class Book {
    public:
    string title;
    string author;
    string ISBN;
    double price;
    int stock;
};

int main() {
    Book book;
    book.title = "The Great Gatsby";
    book.author = "F. Scott Fitzgerald";
    book.ISBN = "9780743273565";
    book.price = 15.99;
    book.stock = 25;

    ofstream outFile;
    outFile.open("book.bin", ios::binary);

    outFile.write((char*)&book, sizeof(book));

    outFile.close();

    cout << "Book information saved to file." << endl;

    return 0;
}

4     Write a program that reads the contents of a file containing Book objects and prints them to the console. 
The program should use the fstream library to open the file, read the Book objects one at a time, and print their title, author, 
ISBN, price and stock to the console.

Ans:

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

class Book {
    public:
    string title;
    string author;
    string ISBN;
    double price;
    int stock;
};

int main() {
    ifstream inFile;
    inFile.open("book.bin", ios::binary);

    if (!inFile) {
        cout << "Error opening file" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    Book book;
    while (inFile.read((char*)&book, sizeof(book))) {
        cout << "Title: " << book.title << endl;
        cout << "Author: " << book.author << endl;
        cout << "ISBN: " << book.ISBN << endl;
        cout << "Price: " << book.price << endl;
        cout << "Stock: " << book.stock << endl;
        cout << endl;
    }

    inFile.close();

    return 0;
}
